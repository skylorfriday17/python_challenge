For the Challenge Assignment of Module 3 for DU Data Bootcamp

##  Assignment Description
In this challenge I used python code to read csv files and manipulate its data to extract my desired outcome. I was able to perform a financial analysis of profit and loss to determine the net profit/loss over the given time period along with the average change over time. I was also able to give election results based on a vote count of given candidates in a csv file. I determined how many total votes there were and how many went to each candidate. I calculated the percentage of total votes each candidate recieved and coded a conditional to provide a winner after all calculations were complete.

### Sources
The only real sources I used outside of course material was the Xpert Learning Assistant and the AskBCS Learning Assisstance. I used code that the AI provided me and also used some references to helpful tips that the BCS assistant gave me.
